I am a Canadian software develope living London Ontario. I've spent most of my career building big things in small boxes. I've used an eclectic mix of languages along the way. I'm currently aspiring to build a stable of side projects while working full time and raising a family.

I've been lucky to have a successful career and made a lot of life-long friends along the way

## Cineplex Digtial Media

Bringing a custom digtial menu board and in store interactive advertising experience to next generateion of technologies and a new phase of growth.

## binnj

Created enterprise iOS applications for the mobile workforce. 

## Cisco Systems

Contiued a lot of the great work we'd started at TVWorks with a lot of familiar faces and began delving into what web technologies could offer the interactive cable experience. This is where I also first got my taste of professional iOS develpment.

## TVWorks (Liberate Technologies)

Creating an magical platform for Java applications on the digital cable set-top device. Massively underpowered hardware, very constrained resources. So. Much. Fun. This was my formative experience as a software developer and the best teams I've worked with.

## ZTR Control Systems

Staring as an intern making great embedded applications for remote monitoring industrial equipment. We built some great things during my time at ZTR and I'm really proud to see how well they've been doing and the amazing products they are still building today.
