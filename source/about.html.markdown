description: I am a Canadian software developer. I've spent most of my career building big things in small boxes. I've used an eclectic mix of languages along the way. Most recently I've been aspiring to build a stable of side projects. Initially I plan to revitalize first iOS app Zengaku and to follow up with some fitness tracking apps. But I'll play it by ear.  I plan to participate more in Open Source projects and maybe release some Open Source porjects as well along the way. iOS/Mac development is an ongoing passion of mine among other things.
