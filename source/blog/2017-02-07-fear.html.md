A common refrain these days is that people are unaware of their own privilege. Sometimes this is something observed when there is some criticism of those who are protesting so hard against the changes going on around us these days. 

We also had the benefit of not being put in a place where our coworkers were taking food off our plates. We had the privilege of being in a high paying and plentiful job market. We had education and skills that insulated us quite a bit from globalization. We aren't better than those who espouse these fears. We had the privilege and good fortune to not be faced with the same trials many of these people have been faced with. I do not agree with their position.
