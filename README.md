# The Codable Things Blog

My personal blog. This is very much still a work-in-progress. As am I. 

I also should let it be known that this is just a blatant attempt to recreate the same basic static site generation setup that Ash Furrow published and discussed in his personal blog. 

* Here's a link to his repo: [Ash Furrow's Blog Repo](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog)
* Here's a blog entry from this site that's also relevant: [Building Static Sites with Middleman](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-static-sites-with-middleman/)

I've recently grown fond of VueJS and I'm likely going to spend some time this year transitioning my staticly generated blog to use the [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) project instead. But first I'm going to work on making updating my site a bit more of a habit and work on my writing skills and other things in the process. I may have to go all meta and write about that process.


### NOTES

1. Build the site using: `rake build`
2. Publich the site using: `rake publish`
